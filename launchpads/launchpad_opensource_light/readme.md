# Landing zone - launchpad open source light

The open source launchpad light provides the base GitOps capabilities required to enable your infrastructure as code environment on Azure to deploy the Cloud Adoption Framework Terraform Landing Zones. It is a foundational set of service from a security, governance and provisioning perspective that will take ownership of the lifecycle management of your landing zones. Apart from the Azure running costs the open source launchpad does not require a specific license to run. The project is supported by the open source community and you can fill issues to request new features or report a defect.

The main objectives of the launchpad open source light are:

* Secure remote state management
* GitOps services to control IaC through git

## Architecture Diagram

The following components are deployed by the opensource_light launchpad:

## Requirements

To support the features set of the open source light launchpad you need to get:

| Access context | Required privileges |
| -------------- | --------------------|
| Subscription   | Contributor Role    |

## Supported type of subscriptions

The open source light launchpad has been tested on:
- Azure Pass
- Trial
- MSDN Subscriptions
- Microsoft AIRS (Microsoft Internal Field Subscriptions)
- Enterprise Agreement
- CSP

## Remote state management

The open source light launchpad stores all landing zones states into a geo-replicated Azure storage account. You can initialize the launchpad using the CAF rover dev container toolbox. The CAF rover is a versioned container that contains the launchpad and rover command.

When you initialize the launchpad you need to define an Azure region. This Azure region will be the primary region used to store the remote state and any related secrets and keys.

The following services are deployed:

- <b>Storage account </b> - stores all landing zones Terraform states
- <b>Virtual network </b> - isolates the traffic between the different services like storage account, keyvault, DevOps agents.
- <b>Key Vault</b> - Azure HSM to store the secrets generated by the launchpad. Various access policies are defined on the Key Vault:
  - Grant access to an Azure AD group. Members from that group (DevOps engineer) can access from the CAF rover to build or improve an existing landing zone.
  - Grant access to the Azure DevOps agents to the secrets

## GitOps services

The current version only support Azure Devops organizations. To deploy the launchpad you need to reference an Azure Devops projects. When you deploy the launchpad the following services are enabled:

- <b>Git Repository</b> - stores a master repository of your private launchpad, your landing zones and blueprints.
- <b>Configuration Registry</b> - stores the configuration settings for the landing zones across different environments
- <b>Self hosted build agents</b> - build artifacts and push them into respositories
- <b>Self hosted release agents </b> - release agent to deploy the landing zones
- <b>Identity</b> - Create a set of Azure AD applications, security groups and managed service identities to enable a least privilege gitops environment. For example when a devops engineer deploys a landing zones the CAF rover uses the logged-in Azure session to check if the user has access to the Keyvault access policy. If the devops engineer is member of the Azure AD security group the rover will pull some secrets and impersonate the Terraform deployments under that Azure AD application's privileges. We use that pattern to simplify the transition to a pipeline execution that only support Azure AD applications or MSIs.
